# Allergy_Crosser
This is a graduation project for a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and was created by Osama Mousa Khrais.

The Allergy Crosser is a mobile application where it specifically aims to make the buying process for people who have an allergy easier and less dangerous by letting them scan the product they want to buy and informing them how dangerous this product is to buy.

This project was developed using an iterative life cycle model; due to the changing nature of software design and implementation, other methods such as waterfall were ruled out; additionally, when selecting the right methodology for the project, we considered the requirements, software design, customer involvement, and implementation.

This project was developed using google's flutter and built in Dart and operated on the Dart virtual machine.

Project start date is 30/06/2021 and the expected delivery day is 13/01/2022.
